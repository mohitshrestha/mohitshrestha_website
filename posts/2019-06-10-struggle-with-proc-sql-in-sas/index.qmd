This week had a good surprise. We learned about data wrangling in SAS
using SQL language. I wasn't expecting to learn SQL in the MSBA program
as the program is primarily focused on SAS and R languages. So I was
surprised and glad that we get to learn a bit of SQL as well, as it is
the language of data science. Beside SAS, we need to know SQL to be
successful in the real world, so having even a basic knowledge of SQL
would be very helpful for me as I learn more and more of data analysis.

The main thing that we were learning was Create Table As Select (CTAS)
in SAS with PROC SQL. It is supposed to be pretty standard DDL, creating
table, adding columns, indexes, creating view, etc. But, I am getting
nervous as I am struggling with it, and this is supposed to be the
basics of SQL.

I sought help from Helper SAS code file provided by the professor, and
even consulted with one of my classmates. There were seven tasks to
solve for this assignment, and I got stuck on #3 for a long time. It
made me more nervous as I had a deadline to meet. I was writing the
codes, but I wasn't sure if I was doing it correctly. I wasn't sure if
the results were correct.

So I turned to Excel spreadsheet, something that I am very familiar
with. Even though it is not the best practice to do what I was doing, I
exported the smaller dataset created in SAS to Excel spreadsheet and
used Excel's Pivot tables, Vlookup. Index-Match, Pivot Chart to cross
check the tables and graphs I was creating in SAS. I resorted to Excel
to understand how the codes I wrote in SAS was working and cross-check
the result output with Excel generated outputs. It is definitely not the
most efficient way of learning, but I didn't want to continue to get
stuck. Using this technique, I was at least able to make good progress
on the assignment for this week.

I hope things get easier as I learn and practice more in the coming
days. I know I am struggling, but I'd like to believe "If there is no
struggle, there is no progress."
