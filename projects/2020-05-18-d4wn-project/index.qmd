**Client:** [data.org](https://data.org) (a collaboration between The Rockefeller Foundation and MasterCard's Center for Inclusive Growth)

**Summary:** "[Use of Business Intelligence for Informal Workers](https://data.org/initiatives/challenge/use-of-business-intelligence-for-informal-workers/)" is one of just eight winning ideas out of over 1200 submissions to the data.org Inclusive Growth and Recovery Challenge.
An estimated 90% of workers in Mozambique are within the informal labor market, providing them little to no safety nets, financial security, or career potential.

[Data for Workforce Nurturing (D4WN)](https://www.d4wn.org/ "Data for Workforce Nurturing (D4WN)") is a project co-created and implemented by a multinational consortium led by [Fundación Capital](https://www.fundacioncapital.org/ "Fundación Capital") (Latin America - Mozambique), [UX Information Technologies](https://www.ux.co.mz/ "UX Information Technologies") (Mozambique), and [Data Elevates](https://www.dataelevates.com/ "Data Elevates") (United States) to empower workers by sharing informal labor market insights and personal advice derived from data generated by two local digital platforms, [Biscate](https://www.biscate.co.mz/ "Biscate") and [Com-Hector](https://conhector.me/ "Com-Hector").
The project is being funded by data.org, a platform for partnerships to build the field of data science for social impact.
We believe that data science can help generate actionable insights for workers, data narratives for stakeholders to engage in data driven decision making for labor policies, and improve the design and development of digital platforms that can service informal workers and improve their financial outcomes.

In this project, **Data Elevates** leads the data analytics approach and implementation to generate and utilizes real-time, data-driven insights from the informal labor market.

**Anticipated Impact:** To improve employability and career opportunities for informal workers across Mozambique.
