## Imran Lalani

**Economist at US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)**

> In addition to being a stellar analyst with superb attention to detail and a great work ethic, in the two years we worked together at ICF, Mohit really impressed me with his commitment to helping others in the team. Always willing to stay late to help a colleague learn how to operate a model or explain a concept to a new hire, Mohit was directly responsible for creating a great team environment and helping onboard others and increase their productivity. Extremely organized and always professional, Mohit was able to navigate challenging deadlines and high pressure situations while remaining calm and consistently delivering high quality work products. Being a major contributor to client deliverables, his strong grasp of the material meant he was always able to clearly and effectively communicate findings internally and externally, making him a vital component of the project teams we were both part of. He has been a genuine pleasure to work with and he would be a wonderful asset to any team in the future.

## Dr. Kenneth Townsend

**Elliott Professor of Economics and Business at Hampden-Sydney College**

> Mohit Shrestha is one of the finest analytical thinkers/modelers that I have worked with in the last 25 years. He and I did many projects together, from modeling and forecasting US economic activity to doing regional analysis for a variety of US and international projects. Mohit is adept in R, SAS, EViews, IMPLAN (Impact Analysis), and many other statistical and data analysis environments. He is a superb writer and speaker. There are comparatively few people I would put on my research team, but Mohit Shrestha is certainly one of them.
